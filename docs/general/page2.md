### Categories & Default Scores

| Category | Score |
|:---------|:------|
| Safe | 0 |

## 1.2 Overcrowding and Privacy 
_Level of covered living and facilities space and privacy provided by the shelter (overcrowding, partitions)_

- Sufficient space and privacy

- Provides protection from the elements, thermal comfort, and a healthy environment.  
- Lack of ventilation, and/or natural light, and/or exposure to vectors.  
- Does not protect against the weather OR provide thermal comfort.  

 _Example Indicators:_ Ventilation, insulation, indoor air quality, presence of mold, exposure to disease vectors.  

#### **Security of Tenure:** Level of security of tenure.  
- Good enough security of tenure.  
- Low/medium risk.  
- High risk.  

 _Example Indicators:_ Land ownership documents, eviction risk, legal recognition of tenure rights.  

#### **Accessibility:** Level of accessibility according to the needs.  
- Accessible.  
- Partially accessible.  
- Not accessible.  
- Not applicable.  

 _Example Indicators:_ Proximity to essential services (healthcare, education, markets), infrastructure for persons with disabilities.  


## Possible Humanitarian Interventions  

### 1. Physical Safety  
- Reinforce or retrofit shelters to improve structural integrity.  
- Provide temporary or transitional shelters in safe locations.  
- Conduct risk assessments for hazards like flooding or earthquakes.  
- Establish community-based safety monitoring and training.  

### 2. Overcrowding and Privacy  
- Distribute materials for internal partitions to improve privacy.  
- Expand shelter space or relocate overcrowded populations.  
- Implement policies to regulate occupancy limits per shelter.  
- Construct communal spaces to reduce indoor congestion.  

### 3. Habitability and Health  
- Improve ventilation, lighting, and drainage in shelters.  
- Distribute mosquito nets and pest control supplies.  
- Provide insulation materials to regulate indoor temperature.  

### 4. Security of Tenure  
- Facilitate legal support for securing land tenure.  
- Advocate for protection against forced evictions.  
- Work with local authorities to formalize tenure rights.  
- Establish grievance mechanisms for housing disputes.  

### 5. Accessibility  
- Improve roads and pathways to key services.  
- Provide ramps and modifications for persons with disabilities.  
- Ensure safe and inclusive access to WASH facilities.  
- Advocate for policies ensuring equitable access to services.
