# What is the SSC?

The SSC, or Shelter Severity Classification system, streamlines analysis by capturing a wide range of critical shelter characteristics. A shelter is much more than four walls and a roof—it protects from the elements, helps prevent illness, and provides a secure, nurturing environment where families can live and thrive. Beyond offering basic safety, a well-designed shelter supports livelihoods, fosters dignity, and instills a sense of security. The SSC brings all these vital elements together in one comprehensive system.

## What We Need from the SSC

The SSC must deliver clear, actionable insights to guide response efforts after an impact. It should help answer these critical questions:

- **Prioritisation and targeting** – Where should we focus our efforts, and who is most in need?  
- **Appropriate interventions** – What are the most suitable response actions?  
- **Measuring impact** – Are our interventions making a positive difference?

## How the SSC is Made

The SSC produces an **overall shelter severity indicator**, scored from **one to five**—with **one** representing the least vulnerable and **five** the most vulnerable. This indicator seeks to answer a fundamental question:  

**Can the household live with dignity and security of tenure in an adequate dwelling with access to community-level services and infrastructure?**  

To assess this, we break down shelter conditions into **three pillars**.  


### **[Pillar 1 - The Shelter:](page2.md)** 

_A shelter must be an enclosed living space that protects occupants from external threats, ensuring safety, dignity, and well-being. It should provide protection against health risks, adverse weather, and natural hazards._

**Themes:**  

- **Physical Safety** – Shelters should offer a secure and protective environment.  
- **Overcrowding and Privacy** – Shelters should provide adequate space and privacy for households.  
- **Habitability and Health** – Shelters should ensure thermal comfort and a healthy living environment.  
- **Security of Tenure** – Households should have stability and legal protection in their living arrangements.  
- **Accessibility** – Shelters should be designed to accommodate the needs of all individuals, including those with disabilities.  

### **[Pillar 2 - Inside The Shelter:](page3.md)**

_People can live properly within their dwelling and perform their normal domestic functions. Defined as the percentage of households able to properly practice domestic functions_

**Themes:**

- **Thermal Comfort (Clothing)** – Percentage of households having sufficient and appropriate quality clothing
- **Energy** – Percentage of households having access to sufficient, safe, and affordable energy supply
- **Cooking** – Percentage of households having sufficient and appropriate items for cooking
- **Sleeping** – Percentage of households having sufficient and appropriate items for safe, healthy, and private sleeping
- **Cleanliness (Hygiene)** – Percentage of households having sufficient and appropriate items to maintain the shelter clean

### **[Pillar 3 - Outside The Shelter:](page4.md)** 

_People have access to common services and community infrastructure for their dwelling. Defined as percentage of households with access to appropriate common services and infrastructure_

- **Access to Services and Resources** - Percentage of households with access to common services and resources
- **Access to Communal Infrastructure** - Percentage of households with access to communal infrastructure
- **Hazards and Risks** - Percentage of households exposed to hazards and risks



## Scores / Phases

Each pillar has a score from one to five, and each score refers to a phase, which can be defined as such:

### **Phase 1 (None / Minimal):**

**Household level:** Household lives in adequate dwellings*, can perform all typical, core domestic functions, and has adequate access to all community-level services and infrastructure

**Area-level:** at least 80% of households are living in shelter conditions described above

### **Phase 2 (Stressed):**

**Household level:** Household lives in adequate dwellings* (with minor issues), can perform most typical, core domestic functions, and has adequate access to most community-level services and infrastructure

**Area-level:** up to 20% of households are living in shelter conditions described in phases 2+3+4+5 (less than 20% are in conditions described in phases 3+4+5)

### **Phase 3 (Crisis):**

**Household level:** Household lives in inadequate dwellings* (with significant issues), is unable to perform many typical, core domestic functions, and has limited adequate access to community-level services and infrastructure

**Area-level:** at least 20% of households are living in shelter conditions described in phases 3+4+5 (less than 20% are in conditions described in phase 4+5)

### **Phase 4 (Critical):**

**Household level:** Household lives in inadequate dwellings* (with severe issues), is unable to perform most typical, core domestic functions, and has very limited adequate access to community-level services and infrastructure

**Area-level:** at least 20% of households are living in shelter conditions described in phases 4+5 (less than 20% are in condition described in phase 5)

### **Phase 5 (Catastrophic):**

**Household level:** Household has no or is living in severely damaged dwelling*, is unable to perform all typical, core domestic function, and has no access to community-level services and infrastructure

**Area-level:** At least 20% of households are living in shelter conditions described above


*Adequate dwelling: safe and secure structure that protects against external threats, health problems, thermal discomfort, natural elements. 

**Note:** as much as possible, the key principles of adequate housing are applied, as considered possible in humanitarian contexts with generally limited availability of data.


# Shelter Vulnerability and Needs Framework  

Ultimately the SSC is divided into preparedness and reponse.

This diagram illustrates a framework for assessing **shelter vulnerability** and **needs** in both **preparedness** and **response** phases. It highlights how vulnerabilities are adjusted before and after a disaster event, integrating predictive modeling and scenario-based hazard assessments.  

## **Preparedness Phase** (Left Side – Purple Border)  
This phase focuses on evaluating **pre-disaster shelter vulnerability** based on:  
- **Three Pillars:**  
  - **Pillar 1** – Safe and dignified dwellings.  
  - **Pillar 2** – Living conditions and ability to practice domestic functions.  
  - **Pillar 3** – Access to services and infrastructure.  
- **General Vulnerabilities and Capacities** – Broader contextual factors influencing shelter conditions.  
- **Pre-disaster Shelter Vulnerability** is calculated and then **adjusted** based on these factors.  
- The **adjusted pre-disaster shelter vulnerability** informs hazard impact assessments, considering multiple **hazards (Hazard 1, Hazard 2, Hazard 3)** and resulting **scenarios (Scenario 1, Scenario 2, Scenario 3).**  

## **Response Phase** (Right Side – Red Border)  
After a disaster **event** occurs, the framework shifts to evaluating **post-disaster shelter needs** by:  
- Using **predictive modeling** to estimate potential impacts.  
- Considering **other vulnerabilities and capacities** that emerge post-disaster.  
- Reassessing shelter needs using the same **three pillars (Pillar 1, Pillar 2, Pillar 3).**  
- Calculating **Post-disaster Shelter Needs**, which are then **adjusted** based on new conditions.  

## **Key Concepts**  
- **SSC (Shelter Severity Classification)** – Used in both preparedness and response to assess vulnerability and needs.  
- **Hazard Scenarios** – Different hazard events lead to different impact scenarios.  
- **Predictive Modeling** – Helps estimate post-disaster conditions before actual assessments occur.  
- **Event Trigger** – Marks the transition from preparedness to response when a disaster occurs.  

This structured approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of shelter vulnerabilities and ensures effective planning before and after a disaster.
