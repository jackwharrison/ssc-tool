## Possible Humanitarian Interventions  

### 1. Physical Safety  
- Reinforce or retrofit shelters to improve structural integrity.  
- Provide temporary or transitional shelters in safe locations.  
- Conduct risk assessments for hazards like flooding or earthquakes.  
- Establish community-based safety monitoring and training.  

### 2. Overcrowding and Privacy  
- Distribute materials for internal partitions to improve privacy.  
- Expand shelter space or relocate overcrowded populations.  
- Implement policies to regulate occupancy limits per shelter.  
- Construct communal spaces to reduce indoor congestion.  

### 3. Habitability and Health  
- Improve ventilation, lighting, and drainage in shelters.  
- Distribute mosquito nets and pest control supplies.  
- Provide insulation materials to regulate indoor temperature.  
- Promote hygiene awareness and disease prevention campaigns.  

### 4. Security of Tenure  
- Facilitate legal support for securing land tenure.  
- Advocate for protection against forced evictions.  
- Work with local authorities to formalize tenure rights.  
- Establish grievance mechanisms for housing disputes.  

### 5. Accessibility
