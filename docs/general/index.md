# What is the SSC?

The SSC, or Shelter Severity Classification system, streamlines analysis by capturing a wide range of critical shelter characteristics. A shelter is much more than four walls and a roof—it protects from the elements, helps prevent illness, and provides a secure, nurturing environment where families can live and thrive. Beyond offering basic safety, a well-designed shelter supports livelihoods, fosters dignity, and instills a sense of security. The SSC brings all these vital elements together in one comprehensive system.

## What We Need from the SSC

The SSC must deliver clear, actionable insights to guide response efforts after an impact. It should help answer these critical questions:

- **Prioritisation and targeting** – Where should we focus our efforts, and who is most in need?  
- **Appropriate interventions** – What are the most suitable response actions?  
- **Measuring impact** – Are our interventions making a positive difference?

## How the SSC is Made

The SSC produces an **overall shelter severity indicator**, scored from **one to five**—with **one** representing the least vulnerable and **five** the most vulnerable. This indicator seeks to answer a fundamental question:  

**Can the household live with dignity and security of tenure in an adequate dwelling with access to community-level services and infrastructure?**  

To assess this, we break down shelter conditions into **three pillars**.  

## Pillars

### **[Pillar 1 - The Shelter:](page2.md)** 

_A shelter must be an enclosed living space that protects occupants from external threats, ensuring safety, dignity, and well-being. It should provide protection against health risks, adverse weather, and natural hazards._

**Themes:**  

- **Physical Safety** – Shelters should offer a secure and protective environment.  
- **Overcrowding and Privacy** – Shelters should provide adequate space and privacy for households.  
- **Habitability and Health** – Shelters should ensure thermal comfort and a healthy living environment.  
- **Security of Tenure** – Households should have stability and legal protection in their living arrangements.  
- **Accessibility** – Shelters should be designed to accommodate the needs of all individuals, including those with disabilities.  

### **[Pillar 2 - Inside The Shelter:](page3.md)**

_A shelter should enable people to live properly within their dwelling and carry out normal domestic activities with dignity and comfort._

**Themes:**  

- **Thermal Comfort (Clothing)** – Households should have sufficient and appropriate clothing to maintain comfort.  
- **Energy** – Households should have access to a safe, reliable, and affordable energy supply.  
- **Cooking** – Households should have appropriate means to prepare and cook food.  
- **Sleeping** – Households should have suitable arrangements for safe, healthy, and private rest.  
- **Cleanliness (Hygiene)** – Households should have the necessary items to keep their living space clean and hygienic.  


### **[Pillar 3 - Outside The Shelter:](page4.md)** 

_A shelter should be supported by access to essential services and communal infrastructure to ensure a safe and sustainable living environment._

**Themes:**  

- **Access to Services and Resources** – Households should have access to essential services and resources needed for daily life.  
- **Access to Communal Infrastructure** – Households should benefit from shared infrastructure that supports well-being and resilience.  
- **Hazards and Risks** – Households should be protected from environmental and structural hazards that pose risks to safety and stability.  

## Scores / Phases

Each pillar is assigned a score from **one to five**, with each score corresponding to a specific phase, defined as follows:  

### **Phase 1 (None / Minimal):**

Households live in adequate dwellings, can carry out all essential domestic activities, and have sufficient access to community services and infrastructure.  

### **Phase 2 (Stressed):**

Households live in generally adequate dwellings with minor issues, can perform most essential domestic activities, and have sufficient access to most community services and infrastructure.  

### **Phase 3 (Crisis):**

Households live in inadequate dwellings with significant issues, struggle to perform many essential domestic activities, and have limited access to community services and infrastructure.  

### **Phase 4 (Critical):**

Households live in inadequate dwellings with severe issues, are unable to perform most essential domestic activities, and have very limited access to community services and infrastructure.  

### **Phase 5 (Catastrophic):**

Households have no shelter or are living in a severely damaged dwelling, are unable to perform any essential domestic activities, and have no access to community services and infrastructure.

**Note:**

Adequate dwelling: safe and secure structure that protects against external threats, health problems, thermal discomfort, natural elements. 

As much as possible, the key principles of adequate housing are applied, as considered possible in humanitarian contexts with generally limited availability of data.

## Other Vulnerabilities and Overall Scoring

The scores from these three pillars combine to determine the **Overall Shelter Severity Score**, which is calculated using a **decision tree** method. Each unique combination of pillar scores corresponds to a specific overall score. More details on the default decision tree used by the Global Shelter Cluster can be found **[here](page5.md)**.

In addition to the three pillars, the SSC framework also considers **baseline vulnerability** factors. These factors can heighten a household’s overall vulnerability but do not directly fit within any of the three pillars. Examples include poverty rate and literacy rate—while they do not pertain directly to shelter or settlement conditions, a household without financial support is likely to be more vulnerable than one with access to resources.

If a community exceeds a certain vulnerability threshold, it is classified as vulnerable. 

When combined with the **Overall Shelter Severity Score**, this classification results in a new metric: the **Adjusted Severity Score**. If a community is deemed vulnerable, the **Adjusted Severity Score** will be _higher_ than the **Overall Shelter Severity Score**.

# Shelter Severity Classification Framework  

Ultimately, the SSC is structured around two key phases: **preparedness** and **response**.

## Preparedness  

The **Shelter Severity Classification (SSC) Framework** follows a cyclical process designed to enhance both preparedness and response. It begins by establishing a **baseline** using existing data, structured around the three pillars to generate an overall **Shelter Severity Score**. To refine this, additional vulnerability data—factors beyond the pillars, such as poverty rates—is incorporated to produce an **Adjusted SSC Score**.  

With this adjusted score, we then analyze **region-specific hazards** to model various **likely post-impact scenarios**. These scenarios help anticipate shelter needs and inform strategic planning before a disaster occurs.  

Once an event occurs, the process transitions into the **response phase**.  

## Response  

In the immediate aftermath of an event, **impact data** is the primary source of information. This includes event-specific details such as a community’s proximity to a storm’s path or the intensity of an earthquake’s tremors. By comparing this data with the pre-established **scenarios**, predictive modeling can be used to estimate which communities are most affected.  

As more **real-time data** becomes available, the SSC framework is **refined and updated** to better reflect on-the-ground conditions. This adjusted classification then guides **humanitarian interventions**, ensuring resources are directed where they are needed most. Additionally, hazard assessments can be revised to account for new risks emerging post-disaster.  

At the conclusion of the response phase, the updated framework is **integrated back into preparedness planning**, ensuring that lessons learned from the current event contribute to stronger, more effective disaster readiness for the future.
