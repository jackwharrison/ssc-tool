This section presents an assessment of the **safety and adequacy of dwellings** within the selected area. The data is expressed as the **percentage of households** living in different shelter conditions, categorized into five phases:  

### **Definition**  
The structure is defined as an **enclosed living space that protects from external threats**, including health hazards, weather conditions, and natural disasters. The percentages represent the proportion of households in each phase based on their dwelling conditions.  

### **Phases of Shelter Conditions**  
- **Phase 1 (None/Minimal):** Households living in adequate dwellings with no major issues.  
- **Phase 2 (Stressed):** Households in generally adequate dwellings but experiencing minor issues.  
- **Phase 3 (Crisis):** Households living in inadequate dwellings with significant issues.  
- **Phase 4 (Critical):** Households residing in severely inadequate dwellings.  
- **Phase 5 (Catastrophic):** Households facing extreme shelter inadequacy, posing severe risks.  

### **Displayed Information**  
- The **percentage of households** falling within each phase is shown, reflecting the overall condition of housing in the area.  
- A higher percentage in **Phase 1** indicates **better housing conditions**, while a higher percentage in **Phases 3-5** signals **severe shelter vulnerabilities**.  
- This data helps **identify populations in need of urgent shelter interventions** and informs **response planning for housing improvements**.  


## Pillar 2 Scores

This section assesses whether **households can properly live within their dwellings and perform normal domestic functions**. The data is represented as the **percentage of households** classified into different phases based on their ability to carry out essential daily activities.  

### **Definition**  
Domestic functionality refers to the ability of a household to perform **typical core domestic functions**, such as cooking, sleeping, washing, and storing belongings in a safe and dignified manner.  

### **Phases of Domestic Functionality**  
- **Phase 1 (None/Minimal):** Household can perform all typical, core domestic functions without restriction.  
- **Phase 2 (Stressed):** Household can perform most domestic functions, but some may be limited.  
- **Phase 3 (Crisis):** Household is unable to perform many typical domestic functions.  
- **Phase 4 (Critical):** Household is unable to perform most domestic functions, significantly impacting well-being.  

### **Displayed Information**  
- The **percentage of households** in each phase is shown, indicating the extent to which families can live and function properly in their homes.  
- A **high percentage in Phase 1** suggests that most households have the necessary conditions to perform domestic activities.  
- A **high percentage in Phases 3-4** indicates a severe lack of functional living spaces, requiring urgent humanitarian intervention.  
- This data helps identify **populations facing inadequate living conditions** and informs **shelter and infrastructure response planning**.  


## Pillar 3 Scores

This section evaluates whether **households have access to essential community services and infrastructure** within their living environment. The data is presented as the **percentage of households** classified into different phases based on their level of access.  

### **Definition**  
Access to common services and infrastructure refers to the availability of **essential facilities** such as water, electricity, roads, markets, healthcare, waste management, and other public services that support daily life.  

### **Phases of Access to Community Services and Infrastructure**  
- **Phase 1 (None/Minimal):** Household has adequate access to all necessary community-level services and infrastructure.  
- **Phase 2 (Stressed):** Household has adequate access to most essential services and infrastructure, but some gaps exist.  
- **Phase 3 (Crisis):** Household has limited adequate access to community-level services, affecting daily life.  
- **Phase 4 (Critical):** Household has very limited adequate access to necessary services and infrastructure, leading to severe constraints.  

### **Displayed Information**  
- The **percentage of households** in each phase is shown, indicating the extent to which people can rely on essential services.  
- A **higher percentage in Phase 1** suggests that most households have good access to necessary services and infrastructure.  
- A **higher percentage in Phases 3-4** indicates significant gaps in service availability, requiring urgent improvements.  
- This data helps identify **regions where infrastructure and service access need strengthening** to improve household well-being.

## Adjusted Severity Scores


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f201410b-1efa-4652-8a12-a6924b6b7aca)

This section provides a **holistic assessment** of household living conditions, incorporating **shelter adequacy, access to community services and infrastructure, and underlying vulnerability factors** such as poverty and literacy rates. The percentages represent the proportion of households classified into different severity phases after adjusting for baseline vulnerabilities.  

### **Definition**  
This adjusted severity score accounts for:  
- **Dwelling adequacy** (safety, security, and living conditions).  
- **Ability to perform essential domestic functions** (cooking, sleeping, hygiene, storage).  
- **Access to essential community services and infrastructure** (water, electricity, health, transportation).  
- **Other vulnerability factors** (poverty levels, literacy rates, socio-economic stressors).  

### **Phases of Adjusted Severity**  
- **Phase 1 (None/Minimal):** Household lives in **adequate** dwellings, can perform all **core domestic functions**, and has **adequate access** to all community-level services and infrastructure.  
- **Phase 2 (Stressed):** Household has **minor issues** in one or more areas (shelter, domestic functionality, or infrastructure access), but remains mostly stable.  
- **Phase 3 (Crisis):** Household lives in **inadequate** dwellings (significant issues), struggles to perform **many** domestic functions, and has **limited** access to community services.  
- **Phase 4 (Critical):** Household lives in **severely inadequate** dwellings, is **unable to perform most** domestic functions, and has **very limited access** to services and infrastructure.  
- **Phase 5 (Catastrophic):** Household is in **extreme conditions**—living in **severely damaged** or no dwelling, **unable to perform all** domestic functions, and has **no access** to essential services.  

### **Displayed Information**  
- The **percentage of households** in each phase is shown, reflecting the overall severity of living conditions after considering baseline vulnerabilities.  
- A **higher percentage in Phase 1** suggests **good overall living conditions** with minimal vulnerability impacts.  
- A **higher percentage in Phases 3-5** indicates **severe shelter and service deficits**, requiring urgent intervention.  
- This data helps inform **targeted response planning**, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations receive **appropriate support**.

## Overall Shelter Severity Scores
