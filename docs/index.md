### Shelter Severity Classification Tool


<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-trailing-punctuation -->

Welcome to the Shelter Severity Classification Tool training!
It covers access to the system, explains how the system works, how to add indicators and data to the system, how to interpret the results, and how to export the data. This training covers how to use the system as both a user and an admin. We will go through each entity one by one, so you can better understand how the tool works.

If you are using this training module for self-study, you are advised to follow the navigation list starting with the General chapter. The Customisation part is optional and is intended for experienced EspoCRM administrators willing to develop their entities and flowcharts further. 

**On the left you can find a navigation overview**
