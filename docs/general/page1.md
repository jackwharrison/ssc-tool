# What is the SSC?

The SSC, or Shelter Severity Classification system, streamlines analysis by capturing a wide range of critical shelter characteristics. A shelter is much more than four walls and a roof—it protects from the elements, helps prevent illness, and provides a secure, nurturing environment where families can live and thrive. Beyond offering basic safety, a well-designed shelter supports livelihoods, fosters dignity, and instills a sense of security. The SSC brings all these vital elements together in one comprehensive system.

## What We Need from the SSC

The SSC must deliver clear, actionable insights to guide response efforts after an impact. It should help answer these critical questions:

- **Prioritisation and targeting** – Where should we focus our efforts, and who is most in need?  
- **Appropriate interventions** – What are the most suitable response actions?  
- **Measuring impact** – Are our interventions making a positive difference?

## How the SSC is Made

The SSC produces an **overall shelter severity indicator**, scored from **one to five**—with **one** representing the least vulnerable and **five** the most vulnerable. This indicator seeks to answer a fundamental question:  

**Can the household live with dignity and security of tenure in an adequate dwelling with access to community-level services and infrastructure?**  

To assess this, we break down shelter conditions into **three pillars**.  


### **[Pillar 1 - The Shelter:](page2.md)** 

_A shelter must be an enclosed living space that protects occupants from external threats, ensuring safety, dignity, and well-being. It should provide protection against health risks, adverse weather, and natural hazards._

**Themes:**  

- **Physical Safety** – Shelters should offer a secure and protective environment.  
- **Overcrowding and Privacy** – Shelters should provide adequate space and privacy for households.  
- **Habitability and Health** – Shelters should ensure thermal comfort and a healthy living environment.  
- **Security of Tenure** – Households should have stability and legal protection in their living arrangements.  
- **Accessibility** – Shelters should be designed to accommodate the needs of all individuals, including those with disabilities.  

### **[Pillar 2 - Inside The Shelter:](page3.md)**

_A shelter should enable people to live properly within their dwelling and carry out normal domestic activities with dignity and comfort._

**Themes:**  

- **Thermal Comfort (Clothing)** – Households should have sufficient and appropriate clothing to maintain comfort.  
- **Energy** – Households should have access to a safe, reliable, and affordable energy supply.  
- **Cooking** – Households should have appropriate means to prepare and cook food.  
- **Sleeping** – Households should have suitable arrangements for safe, healthy, and private rest.  
- **Cleanliness (Hygiene)** – Households should have the necessary items to keep their living space clean and hygienic.  


### **[Pillar 3 - Outside The Shelter:](page4.md)** 

_A shelter should be supported by access to essential services and communal infrastructure to ensure a safe and sustainable living environment._

**Themes:**  

- **Access to Services and Resources** – Households should have access to essential services and resources needed for daily life.  
- **Access to Communal Infrastructure** – Households should benefit from shared infrastructure that supports well-being and resilience.  
- **Hazards and Risks** – Households should be protected from environmental and structural hazards that pose risks to safety and stability.  


## Scores / Phases

Each pillar is assigned a score from **one to five**, with each score corresponding to a specific phase, defined as follows:  

### **Phase 1 (None / Minimal):**

Households live in adequate dwellings, can carry out all essential domestic activities, and have sufficient access to community services and infrastructure.  

### **Phase 2 (Stressed):**

Households live in generally adequate dwellings with minor issues, can perform most essential domestic activities, and have sufficient access to most community services and infrastructure.  

### **Phase 3 (Crisis):**

Households live in inadequate dwellings with significant issues, struggle to perform many essential domestic activities, and have limited access to community services and infrastructure.  

### **Phase 4 (Critical):**

Households live in inadequate dwellings with severe issues, are unable to perform most essential domestic activities, and have very limited access to community services and infrastructure.  

### **Phase 5 (Catastrophic):**

Households have no shelter or are living in a severely damaged dwelling, are unable to perform any essential domestic activities, and have no access to community services and infrastructure.

### **Note:**

**Adequate dwelling:** safe and secure structure that protects against external threats, health problems, thermal discomfort, natural elements. 

As much as possible, the key principles of adequate housing are applied, as considered possible in humanitarian contexts with generally limited availability of data.


# Shelter Severity Classification Framework  

Ultimately, the SSC is structured around two key phases: **preparedness** and **response**.

This diagram illustrates a framework for assessing **shelter vulnerability** and **needs** in both **preparedness** and **response** phases. It highlights how vulnerabilities are adjusted before and after a disaster event, integrating predictive modeling and scenario-based hazard assessments.  

## **Preparedness Phase** (Left Side – Purple Border)  
This phase focuses on evaluating **pre-disaster shelter vulnerability** based on:  
- **Three Pillars:**  
  - **Pillar 1** – Safe and dignified dwellings.  
  - **Pillar 2** – Living conditions and ability to practice domestic functions.  
  - **Pillar 3** – Access to services and infrastructure.  
- **General Vulnerabilities and Capacities** – Broader contextual factors influencing shelter conditions.  
- **Pre-disaster Shelter Vulnerability** is calculated and then **adjusted** based on these factors.  
- The **adjusted pre-disaster shelter vulnerability** informs hazard impact assessments, considering multiple **hazards (Hazard 1, Hazard 2, Hazard 3)** and resulting **scenarios (Scenario 1, Scenario 2, Scenario 3).**  

## **Response Phase** (Right Side – Red Border)  
After a disaster **event** occurs, the framework shifts to evaluating **post-disaster shelter needs** by:  
- Using **predictive modeling** to estimate potential impacts.  
- Considering **other vulnerabilities and capacities** that emerge post-disaster.  
- Reassessing shelter needs using the same **three pillars (Pillar 1, Pillar 2, Pillar 3).**  
- Calculating **Post-disaster Shelter Needs**, which are then **adjusted** based on new conditions.  

## **Key Concepts**  
- **SSC (Shelter Severity Classification)** – Used in both preparedness and response to assess vulnerability and needs.  
- **Hazard Scenarios** – Different hazard events lead to different impact scenarios.  
- **Predictive Modeling** – Helps estimate post-disaster conditions before actual assessments occur.  
- **Event Trigger** – Marks the transition from preparedness to response when a disaster occurs.  

This structured approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of shelter vulnerabilities and ensures effective planning before and after a disaster.
