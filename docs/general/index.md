# What is the SSC?

The SSC, or Shelter Severity Classification system, streamlines analysis by capturing a wide range of critical shelter characteristics. A shelter is much more than four walls and a roof—it protects from the elements, helps prevent illness, and provides a secure, nurturing environment where families can live and thrive. Beyond offering basic safety, a well-designed shelter supports livelihoods, fosters dignity, and instills a sense of security. The SSC brings all these vital elements together in one comprehensive system.

## What do we need from the SSC?

We need to be able to effectively answer the following questions in the aftermath of an impact:

1. Prioritisation and targeting - where and who should we target?
2. What interventions are most appropriate?
3. Are we having a positive impact?

## How is the SSC made?

The primary output of the SSC is the overall shelter severity indicator, which is scored from one to five, with one being the least vulnerable, and five being the most vulnerable. This indicator tries to answer the following: can the household live with dignity and security of tenure in an adequate dwelling with access to community-level services and infrastructure.

To answer that, we have divided the components of a shelter into three pillars.

### **[Pillar 1 - The Shelter:](page2.md)**

- **Overcrowding and privacy** - Percentage of households living with sufficient space and privacy in their shelters
- **Habitability and Health** - Percentage of households living in shelters providing thermal comfort and healthy environment
- **Security of Tenure** - Percentage of households living with security of tenure
